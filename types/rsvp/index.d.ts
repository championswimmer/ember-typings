          Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The
          primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which
          registers callbacks to receive either a promiseâ€™s eventual value or the reason
          why the promise cannot be fulfilled.

          Terminology
          -----------

          - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.
          - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.
          - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).
          - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.
          - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.
          - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.

          A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

          Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled
          state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the
          rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.

          Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a
          promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's
          settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will
          itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will
          itself fulfill.


          Basic Usage:
          ------------

          ```js
          let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
              // on success
              resolve(value);

              // on failure
              reject(reason);
          });

          promise.then(function(value) {
              // on fulfillment
          }, function(reason) {
              // on rejection
          });
          ```

          Advanced Usage:
          ---------------

          Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as
          `XMLHttpRequest`s.

          ```js
          function getJSON(url) {
              return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
              let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

              xhr.open('GET', url);
              xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;
              xhr.responseType = 'json';
              xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');
              xhr.send();

              function handler() {
                  if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {
                  if (this.status === 200) {
                      resolve(this.response);
                  } else {
                      reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));
                  }
                  }
              };
              });
          }

          getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {
              // on fulfillment
          }, function(reason) {
              // on rejection
          });
          ```

          Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.

          ```js
          Promise.all([
              getJSON('/posts'),
              getJSON('/comments')
          ]).then(function(values){
              values[0] // => postsJSON
              values[1] // => commentsJSON

              return values;
          });
          ```
        */
        class Promise<T> implements PromiseLike<T> {
            then<TResolved = T, TRejected = never>(
                onfulfilled?: OnFulfilled<T, TResolved>,
                onrejected?: OnRejected<TRejected>,
                label?: string
            ): PromiseLike<TResolved | TRejected>;

            catch<TRejected = never>(
                onrejected?: OnRejected<TRejected>,
                label?: string
            ): PromiseLike<TRejected>;
        }

        function resolve(): PromiseLike<void>;
        function resolve<T>(t: T): PromiseLike<T>;
    }

    export default RSVP;
}
